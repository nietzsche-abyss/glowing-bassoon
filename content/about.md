## About Me

Hi, I'm Markus, a passionate malware researcher, cybersecurity specialist, and tech enthusiast.

To delve into the abyss of systems, to confront the unseen forces lurking in the shadows of macOS and Linux â€” this is my pursuit. I do not merely study malware; I dismantle its very essence, tracing the veins of its creation to expose its vulnerabilities. In the dance between attacker and defender, I choose the path of red teaming, where power is claimed through understanding and mastery of the unseen. My craft is not a task, but a confrontation with the unknown, and in that confrontation, I become stronger.

Feel free to explore my blog for technical insights, tutorials, and personal projects. I'm excited to share my journey and connect with like-minded individuals!
